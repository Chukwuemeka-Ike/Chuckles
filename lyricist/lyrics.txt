Annihilate, I'm wide awake, be very afraid (Afraid)
I'm in my own world, give me space
I'm in my own universe, give me space (Space, yeah)

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
Weezy Carter, I'm 'bout to go Peter Parker
I'm Spider-Man, if he ain't me, he just a creepy crawler
Tunechi spark the lighter, pull up in a new Ferrari Spider
Spider web necklace with the diamonds
She'll turn to Spider-Woman if I bite her
I will not go back and forth with you
I see you got the black widow with you
You should've had a black hero with you
I give an opp arachnophobia
I've been litty since I flicked the lighter
Since I was an itsy bitsy spider
They've been tryna wash the spider out
I got spiders crawlin' out your mouth, Spider-Verse

Only way to go is go the distance
Nothing can shake me now
Nothing can break me down
Tell the whole town, we popping now
Nothing can shake me now

Not done fightin'

[Verse 1: A$AP Rocky]
Uh, wakin' up, feelin' like the thankful one
Count up my ones, lacin' up my favorite 1s
One-of-a-kind, one of one, the only one
Got one shot and one chance to take it once
Kiss my mama on the forehead, 'forе I get the code rеd
'Cause I was born, bred to go in, toast ready
Swing by 410, beef patty, cornbread
In the concrete jungle, where my home is
All get focused, all raise your toastes
The nickname: Mr. Keen-To-Do-the-Mostest
I was livin' down bad in my folks' crib
Now I'm laughin' to the bank and the joke is
Did more things than folks did, or folks get
We been gettin' this fly since some poor kids
My rich friends and my broke friends coexist
They love to mix, and we know what it is

Hummingbird, summer song

Hangin' in the balance
Have you brought the light back?
Pen pal on a night shift

Realising she might
Be all I need in this life

[Verse 1: James Blake]
When I saw a cold snap
I wasn't with the season
Tag was on the ankle
And outside, there was a ceiling
In here, paper walls are
Pushin' back on you like
Eventually you push through
The moment that you realise

I am the one that bust down your rose gold, had your diamonds dancin'
I picked you up in that Bentley Mulsanne, when them sirens was glarin'

The way I let you come into my life and take my heart away, it's like a robbery
Every time you look up on the charts, now, you seein' me, I hope you proud of me
I got you bussed down, Patek Philippes, ain't no way you goin' back to Cartis
And I splurge on her, she like "Saint Laurent me"

Sick and tired of humility
Can't believe that they would hate on me

They expect so much from me, it sucks for me, lucky me
